        "Hi, I'm Bill Maggs, I work on game products at Mozilla. 
In the first two talks today, we heard about how technologies like asm.js will provide native games a home on the Web; we talked a lot about the Web as a target for game developrment. Now we will concentrate on the Web as an ENVIRONMENT in which to troublshoot and optimize your game and get it to market, with human-written rather than machine-generated Javascript the main ingredient. We hope to get you some 
You've seen the future; now using the example of  JS games, we'll talk about the present, with the help of some guests that are all in on the Web for games.  We think you might be surprised at the state of the art for tools and engines for JS games, and at what developers are finding when they take their games to the Web."

        "But first, a short history of Web game development as geology: about 600 million years ago, there was a lot of ooze in the oceans, and not many animals. 
Similarly, in the Precambrian era  of games on the Web, there was Flash. This was a thing; no one knows if it was worm, a colony, or some kind of shoft shell trilobite. It was kind of trying to be all things to all people. Get it? Yeah, analogy. And for a while, it totally kicked ass. But it did not last.  "

        "Today the same thing is happening as did to animals in the geologic past: some design patterns are winning.  As game developers you have always asked some basic questions about building for the Web: Where’s the toolchain? Wheres the workflow? At Mozilla we're not interested in replacing your existing tools, but rather augmenting the way you work now.  Here to talk  about that is Angelina Fabbro from the Mozilla Developer Tools team.""

        "It's not an accident or coincidence that we were recently featured on PRWire in Times Square for our developer tools. This photo was taken during Mobile World Congress, where we also had some big annoucements just like this week."

        "We've seen today that it's both feasible and promising to port your game to the web with asm.js, but what happens when your game lands on the web? How do you debug any cross-platform issues in an efficient manner? Further, here we are talking about porting your game from another language - what about JavaScript developers that are making games on the web in their browser as it's first platform? At Mozilla, we've been working on providing tools to suit both category of developer, and noting that often the needs of the two overlap."

        "The first thing you're going to notice is that your game ends up in the context of a document object model that comprises what we colloquially refer to as a 'webpage' and often when there is more sophisticated behavior, an 'application'. One of the interesting things about working on the web is the control over your environment. Because you have control over the detail of the envinronment that you've embedded your game, you can style it and also program it in compelling ways to provide auxillary content to your users, whether it be adds or additional social features."

Our strong conviction is that  the Web will be the biggest platform - it will be far from the only one; the audience won't just be large, but deep as well as wide, with lots of ways for you to make them happy and for them to make you money. "
